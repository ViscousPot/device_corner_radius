# Device Corner Radius

This plugin uses native APIs to get the corner radius of the device.

For Android, it uses the `WindowInsets` API released along Android S.
> Note: The `WindowInsets` API is only available on Android S (API 31) and above.
> Read more about the API [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/theming/rounded-corners)

For iOS, it read private `_displayCornerRadius` property of `UIScreen` class.
> The Swift code used in this package was taken directly from [@kylebshr's ScreenCorners](https://github.com/kylebshr/ScreenCorners)

## Usage

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:device_corner_radius/device_corner_radius.dart';
```

And then use the `getDeviceCornerRadius()` method:

```dart
BorderRadius cornerRadius = await DeviceCornerRadius.getCornerRadius();
```
